## I'm a university student pursuing a career in cybersecurity/information security. Currently, I'm active in my university's cybersecurity club, where I contribute in CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions, as well as club infrastructure and operations. 

## On this site, I'll be sharing CTF writeups, threat intelligence blog posts, and more.
